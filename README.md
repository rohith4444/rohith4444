## 🏆 Achievements

### 🥇 AI Hackathon Winner - Corp-Agent Vibe Coding (San Francisco, Aug 16, 2025)

**The Challenge:** In a 4-hour sprint, our team tackled a real sales pain point — companies receive tons of inbound calls daily, with sales reps wasting valuable time reviewing call transcripts in CRMs, often spending ~5 minutes per contact just to figure out if a lead is worth pursuing.

**Our Solution:** Built an AI-powered sales-call filtering system (cheekily named "Legit or Sh*t" by the team 😅) that automates the entire lead qualification process using a two-layer AI system that transcribes calls, adds real-time company context, and intelligently classifies them as potential leads, spam, or uncertain.

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Workflow 1 (Automatic):** Triggered in real-time during live calls, instantly labeling leads before they enter the CRM system
- **Workflow 2 (Manual):** CRM-integrated batch processing to label and filter existing contacts at scale

**Impact:** Sales teams can save 1000+ hours annually and cut operational costs by ~50% by filtering out low-value calls before they reach the CRM.

**🏆 Outcome:** Won the hackathon for innovative approach, rapid execution, and demonstrable business value in just 4 hours!
