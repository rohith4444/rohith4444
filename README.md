# 👋 Hey, I’m Rohith — AI Enthusiast & Engineer

I’m passionate about building machines that think, reason, and act like humans. With over 5 years of experience in data science, software engineering, and AI research, I've worked on **Generative AI**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Agentic Systems**.

My focus is on creating intelligent systems—like **agent-based architectures** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines—that reshape how we interact with knowledge and data.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- Design agent-based systems for dynamic reasoning and decision-making  
- Build RAG pipelines to supercharge LLM capabilities  
- Explore prompt engineering, model alignment, and open-source AI tooling

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧠 Agentic Corrective RAG System for Research Paper Queries  
A production-ready RAG system that synthesizes academic content using multi-retriever setups, LLM-based document evaluation, and smart query rewriting with web search integration.  
**Tech:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, Faiss, OpenAI, PostgreSQL

### 🔤 English-to-Telugu Translation using Mistral 7B  
Fine-tuned a Mistral 7B Instruct model with QLoRA for high-quality English–Telugu translation using a 140k sentence-pair dataset.  
**Tech:** PyTorch, Transformers, Hugging Face, QLoRA

### 🌍 pygeoboundaries  
A Python package developed at William & Mary for validating and reviewing geoBoundaries shapefiles. Published on PyPI and integrated into open-source workflows.  
**Tech:** Python, Prefect, Web Scraping, Dataverse API
