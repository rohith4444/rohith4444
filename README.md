# I'm Rohith Reddy, **Data Scientist @ William & Mary.**

With over 3 years of experience in **Data Science,** with a passion for developing **Machine Learning & Deep Learning models** that can help organizations achieve their business objectives. Currently, I work at William & Mary ðŸ”­ geoLab, where I do research on **disinformation detection** on social media. I developed a data pipeline and classification model using **BERT and DBSCAN** algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 98% for the training data and 92% for the test data. Additionally, I work on resolving the issues of geoboundary libraries for William & Mary Geolab.

* One of my recent personal projects was the development of a neural network model that can recognize and classify different types of fruits and vegetables when held by humans in front of a camera. I created a dataset of 44,000 images and achieved a classification accuracy of around 95% using the Inception model.
* I'm always on the lookout for exciting new projects to work on and opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals.
* Feel free to reach out to me if you're interested in working together or just want to chat about technology!
