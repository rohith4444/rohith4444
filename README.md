## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - Developing computer agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to create complex human-like personas with distinct personalities, dispositions, memories, interests, and demographics.
  - Utilizing a wide range of LLMs to generate and manage large-scale population simulations, enabling advanced studies and analyses of human behavior in various scenarios.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - Open-source projects focusing on machine translation tasks for LLMs and other projects within the NLP domain. I'm eager to contribute and volunteer my expertise.
